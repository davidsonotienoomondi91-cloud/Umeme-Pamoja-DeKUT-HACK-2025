## Inspiration

Our inspiration isn't from a spreadsheet; it's from a story we see in neighborhoods all across Kenya.

Imagine a homeowner who has invested in a solar panel. Every day, it generates ample clean energy, but they only use a small fraction of it to charge a single phone and power a lightbulb at night. The rest—kilowatts of valuable power—is completely wasted, vanishing with the setting sun.

Now, imagine their neighbor just a few meters away. They have a growing family and modern needs: an electric shower, a TV for the family to gather around, lights for their children to study, and maybe even a washing machine or an electric cooker. Their demand for energy is high, and they are often left at the mercy of an expensive and unreliable grid, sometimes running out of power when they need it most.

This glaring inefficiency is the heart of our inspiration. On one side of a fence, there is wasted potential. On the other, there is unmet need. Umeme Pamoja was born from the simple idea of building a bridge across that fence—to turn one person's daily waste into their neighbor's reliable power, and in doing so, empower the entire community.

## What it does

Umeme Pamoja is a smart, peer-to-peer energy trading platform. It transforms homes with solar panels into micro-power stations, allowing them to automatically and securely sell their surplus energy to their immediate neighbors. We built our solution on three core principles:
*   **Radical Inclusion:** Accessible via a smartphone app with speech commands and a parallel USSD service for non-smartphone users.
*   **Guaranteed Privacy:** An anonymous user ID system protects both buyers and sellers, preventing community friction.
*   **Seamless Transactions:** Deep integration with M-Pesa ensures every transaction is instant, secure, and trusted.

## How we built it

1.  **User Journey Mapping:** We started by creating internal development personas—a solar owner with surplus power, and a neighbor needing reliable energy. This led us to our core principle of anonymity, using unique user IDs for all transactions to build trust.
2.  **High-Fidelity Mockups:** We designed every screen of the application with this "anonymity-first" approach.
3.  **Interactive Prototyping:** Using **Figma**, we linked these screens into a fully interactive, clickable prototype that demonstrated this anonymous user flow.
4.  **Product Walkthrough:** We then used **Loom** to record a comprehensive demo video, narrating the user journey while clicking through the Figma prototype.
5.  **Centralized Hub:** Finally, we organized all assets into this **GitHub repository** to serve as the single source of truth for our project.

## Built With

*   **Figma:** For the entire UI/UX design and interactive prototyping.
*   **Loom:** For screen-recording our product walkthrough and demo video.
*   **Canva:** For designing our professional presentation slide deck.
*   **GitHub:** As the central repository for all project assets and documentation.
*   **Markdown:** For formatting our project story and this README.

## What's next for Umeme Pamoja

Our path forward is clear and focused. The next steps are to develop the real grid and application, pilot, and then expand.
